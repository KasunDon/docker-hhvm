docker-hhvm
===========

**ATTENTION:** This repository is under construction and the ONLY recommended tag is `:deb`.

| Tag       | Build Status             | Base image             |
| --------- | ------------------------ | ---------------------- |
| :latest   | ![Latest][build-failing] | ubuntu:trusty          |
| :deb      | ![Latest][build-passing] | ubuntu:trusty          |
| :base     | ![Latest][build-passing] | ubuntu:trusty          |
| :dev      | ![Latest][build-failing] | brunoric/hhvm:base     |


Docker images to run PHP applications and scripts under HHVM. The intent of these images is to work *out-of-the-box* as
an [HHVM-FastCGI][fastcgi] server. The default command is `/start.sh` that execute Supervisor to spawn HHVM as a server,
but you can also use this image to run php scripts (or phar applications) as described in *How to use* section. If you 
notice any bug or typo, please let me know. This repository contains the follow images:

- **`:latest`** - This image is an alias to `deb`.
- **`:deb`** - This image uses the official [deb package of HHVM for Ubuntu 14.04][deb-package].
- **`:base`** - This image is just the base for the compiled images (i.e. all of them but `:deb`).
- **`:dev`** - This image contains the development version from [HHVM GitHub repository][repository].

How to get?
-----------

**1) Run a container**

The first method of get the images is directly run a container with the desired tag like the example below:
    
    docker run -it brunoric/hhvm:deb hhvm -a

This command will pull the :deb image (if you do not have it already) and execute `hhvm -a` command (opening an 
interacte shell session).

**2) Pull the image**

You can also pull the desired image tag from the Docker Hub with:
    
    docker pull brunoric/hhvm:deb
    
This command will pull the image (if you do not have it already) without creating any container like the first method 
does. You can also pull all the images from this repository just not adding a tag to the command like the above example:

    docker pull brunoric/hhvm

**3) Build it**

Finally, if you have time (yes, this can take a while if you not building the deb image), you can build the needed image 
from scratch. To do so you need to clone `brunoric/hhvm` from GitHub and use make at the pulled directory  

	make build-<version> # example: make deb
	
With this method you can also make changes on the Dockerfiles fitting the images to your runtime (eg.: you can change 
the CORE_NUMBER enviroment variable to compile faster if you have more than 4 CPU cores). 

How to use?
-----------

**1) HHVM FastCGI server**

As mentioned before, the default command executed by the images is `/start.sh` that execute Supervisor to spawn [HHVM as
a FastCGI][fastcgi] server:

	docker run -p 9000:9000 brunoric/hhvm:deb

After started, this container will have HHVM FastCGI server listen on the port 9000 (eg.: `localhost:9000`). If you have
any problems with the `localhost` ServerName you can use `<CONTAINER_IP>:9000`. To get the `<CONTAINER_IP>` value just 
run the command below:

    docker inspect --format '{{ .NetworkSettings.IPAddress }}' <CONTAINER_ID>
    
**2) HHVM interactive shell**
    
You can start a HHVM interactive shell using:
    
    docker run -it brunoric/hhvm:deb hhvm -a
    
**3) Executing PHP scripts**
    
There are a bunch of ways to do this task (like the others already described have too), but an interesting way is 
execute a script sharing the current folder to the container like the follow example:
 
    docker run --rm -v `pwd`:`pwd` -w `pwd` brunoric/hhvm:deb hhvm script.php
